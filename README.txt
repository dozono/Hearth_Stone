Added a custom item named "Hearth Stone". When on main hand, hold shift and click on a blcok to mark a postion, hold right button and you'll see a green bar charging. When fully charged, release button and you will be teleported to the marked position. 
If there's no marked position, then you will be teleported to a random position within 600 range.
Good luck with that, hope you find some surprises.
